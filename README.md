# Vagrant

Vagrant project for spinning up test VMs.

## Prerequisites

* Install the latest version of [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install)
* Install Oracle's [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Make sure that you install a _compatible_ [version](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/virtualbox). Vagrant tends to lag behind by 1-2 minor release versions for VB support...

> NOTE: For best results install the official VirtualBox package from Oracle's site. Some distributions or community repo's (e.g. rpmfusion) packages may not work with Vagrant.
